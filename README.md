# Directional Backtracking
* Showcases every possible route solution based on the input data, regarding heights of the integers and non-walkable zones.

## Route showcase

* Here you can see how every route is shown in order, where 1 is the starting point and the biggest number is the ending point.
* This means that the shortest route is the min(max number for every backtrack case)
